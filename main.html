		<p>Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another: ‘What! You too? I thought I was the only one. A loving relationship is one in which the loved one is free to be himself—to laugh with me, but never at me; to cry with me, but never because of me…Such a relationship is based upon freedom and can never grow a jealous heart.”</p>
